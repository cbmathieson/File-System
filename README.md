# File-System

This is my (naive) attempt at a log structured file system.

The initial goal was a true log structured file system, but as time elapsed and finals neared,
corners were cut to meet the deadline.

Shell:

I've created an interactive shell script to work with the files and directories. First run "initLLFS.c" then run the "runFileSystem.c"
file and it will tell you the operations that you can use upon initialization. ctrl-d or "exit" to exit.
